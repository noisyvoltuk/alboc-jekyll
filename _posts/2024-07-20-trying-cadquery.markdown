For 3D designs destined for printing, I've long been a fan of OpenSCAD, rather than some of the more visual and interactive designers.

I like to work out the designs in my head and in code, rather than fighting a UI, and I appreciate the simple way that designs can be built up and amended.

Two things though. For one, certain features such as fillets are not easy with OpenSCAD, also secondly it can be somewhat clunky to place elements relative to others.

I've found CadQuery, which claims to offer a richer underlying engine, along with Python as the programming language.

Lets see how it goes.
